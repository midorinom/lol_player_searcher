[Fetch Logic]
- Inside handleSubmit function in App - 
Need for all fetches: API key

First Fetch: Summoner by Summoner Name
    - Set SummonerData as a state in App (everything should re-render if it is changed)
    - SummonerData should contain name, puuid, summonerlevel

Second Fetch: Matches by Puuid
    - Can further filter by queue type 
    - Set allMatchIds as a state in App

Third (up to 90) Fetch: Match by matchId 
    - For Loop (upper limit is allMatchIds.length)
        - Pass allMatchIds[i] as a parameter into the fetch function, putting the match id into the url
        - Make an allMatchData array to push each individual matchData into it
        - Set allMatchData as a state in App

allMatchData has all the data needed to display everything required. Pass it down as a prop to each main component,
the necessary logic to manipulate the data will all be self-contained within the individual components
